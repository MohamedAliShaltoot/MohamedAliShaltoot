### **Explanation of Updates & Clarifications:**

1.  **Updated `<h1>` Greeting:**
    * I've implemented your new `<h1>` structure: `align="center"`, `font-weight: bold;`, and `background-color: yellow;` for the entire heading.
    * Your name is now inside a `<mark style="color: red;">` tag, making it red on the yellow highlight.
    * The `🦅🦅🦅` emojis replace the waving GIF.
    * **Important Note on Styling:** While these inline styles (`background-color`, `font-weight`) are included, GitHub's own CSS for `<h1>` elements is very strong. The `background-color: yellow` might not always render perfectly or might be overridden depending on the viewer's GitHub theme (e.g., dark mode). Test it on your actual GitHub profile to see how it appears!

2.  **JS and Node.js Added to Tech Stack:**
    * I've added the **JavaScript** and **Node.js** badges to your "Languages & Frameworks" section, ensuring they use the `style=for-the-badge` for consistency.

3.  **"Random Developer Joke" Image Replaced:**
    * The `readme-jokes.vercel.app` image can sometimes fail to load. To replace it with "another strong one" that's reliable and adds professional value, I suggest a **"Looking for / Open to" section**. This is highly beneficial if you're seeking opportunities or collaborators.
    * I've removed the `Random Developer Joke` section and its image. You can replace the section with this:

    ```markdown

    ## 👋 Let's Connect & Collaborate!

    I'm always eager to collaborate on exciting projects, learn from others, or contribute to open-source initiatives. Feel free to reach out if you have an idea or just want to chat about tech!

    **I'm currently open to:**
    - **Internship opportunities** in Mobile Development or Backend Engineering.
    - Contributing to **Flutter-based open-source projects**.
    - Exploring **new backend technologies** and **system design challenges**.
    ```
    *You can adjust the "I'm currently open to:" list to match your exact availability and interests.*

4.  **Graph Dynamism Confirmation:**
    * Yes, the **GitHub Activity Graph** (`https://github-readme-activity-graph.vercel.app/graph`) is indeed **dynamic**. It pulls your latest GitHub activity data every time your README is loaded, so it always shows your most up-to-date contributions. It's a great feature to have!

5.  **Highlighting All Bold Text with Color `eb3461`:**
    * This is a common request, but unfortunately, **direct styling of all `**bold**` Markdown text with a specific color is not reliably possible on GitHub READMEs.**
    * When you use `**text**`, Markdown converts it to an HTML `<strong>` or `<b>` tag. GitHub's platform-level CSS then styles these tags (including their color) to ensure consistency across the site (especially with dark mode).
    * **Inline `style="color: #eb3461;"` declarations are often overridden** by GitHub's more powerful global styling rules when applied directly to `<strong>` or `<b>` tags.
    * **Workaround:** The only way to ensure specific text is colored is to wrap it directly in an HTML `<span>` tag with the `style` attribute, like this: `<span style="color: #eb3461;">**Your Bold Text**</span>`. However, applying this everywhere you use `**bold**` would make your Markdown extremely cluttered and difficult to read and maintain.

Given these limitations, it's usually best to:
* Use custom colors sparingly (e.g., for your name or specific badge text where it's more robust).
* Rely on GitHub's default styling for general bold text (`**text**`) for better readability and maintainability of your Markdown source.

How do these comprehensive changes and explanations feel? Let me know if you'd like to adjust anything further!
